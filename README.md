## Getting Started

### Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Navigate through the different sections using the top navigation
3. Configure your plant profiles and cost settings
4. Use the calculator to analyze farm designs
5. Compare different configurations

### First Time Setup
1. **Plant Profiles**: Add or modify crop types and their characteristics
2. **Cost Profiles**: Set your server's redstone component prices
3. **Farm Design**: Configure your plot size and design parameters
4. **Calculator**: Run ROI calculations for different farm types

## Usage Guide

### Adding Plant Profiles
1. Go to the "Plant Profiles" section
2. Click "Add New Plant"
3. Fill in the plant details:
   - **Name**: Crop name (e.g., "Wheat", "Sugar Cane")
   - **Sell Price**: Price per item on your server
   - **Density per Block**: How many plants fit per block (0.0-1.0)
   - **Yield per Plant per Hour**: Items produced per plant per hour
   - **Processing Cost**: Additional cost for processed products

### Configuring Costs
1. Navigate to "Cost Profiles"
2. Set prices for redstone components
3. Click "Save Cost Profile" to apply changes
4. Use "Reset to Defaults" to restore original values

### Running Calculations
1. Go to the "Calculator" section
2. Select a plant type from the dropdown
3. Configure farm parameters:
   - **Layers**: Number of farm layers
   - **Collection Lanes**: Lanes per layer for item collection
   - **Pistons per Plant**: Enable for sugar cane-style farms
   - **Include Unloaders**: Add comparators, hoppers, and chests
4. Click "Calculate ROI" to see results

### Comparing Farms
1. Visit the "Comparison" section
2. Click "Add Farm to Compare"
3. Configure each farm design
4. View side-by-side performance metrics

## Technical Details

### Calculation Methods

#### Plant Density
- **Density per Block**: Accounts for water spacing, redstone wiring, and plant spacing
- **Typical Values**: 0.20-0.33 depending on farm design

#### Cost Calculations
- **Passive Farms**: Collection lanes with hopper minecarts
- **Piston Farms**: Individual pistons per plant with observer sharing
- **Processing**: Additional costs for smelting/processing stations

#### Revenue Projections
- Based on natural random tick rates
- Accounts for plant growth time and yield
- Includes processing time for derived products

### Data Storage
- All data stored in browser's localStorage
- JSON format for easy backup and sharing
- Automatic saving on configuration changes

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: 80+
- **Firefox**: 75+
- **Safari**: 13+
- **Edge**: 80+
